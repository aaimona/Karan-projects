# I had difficulty solving this one, but finally here it is :) One thing that mus be noticed here:
# Unfortunately, I don't know the way for R to realize that it entered the endless loop and quit on its own
# so that it go to the next number. That way I could use for loop to check numbers from a given interval.
# If you want to find e.g. first eight happy numbers, as Karan suggested in his list, you have to go manually.
happy <- function(x) {
  if(class(x) != "numeric") {
    stop("x must be an integer")
  }
  vector <- as.integer(substring(x, seq(nchar(x)), seq(nchar(x))))
  sumsq <- sum(vector^2)
  if(sumsq == 1) {
    return(paste(x, "is a happy number."))
  } else {
  while(sumsq != 1) {
    repeat {vector1 <- as.integer(substring(sumsq, seq(nchar(sumsq)), seq(nchar(sumsq))))
            sum1 <- sum(vector1^2)
            sumsq <- sum1
            if(sumsq == 1) break
    }
  }
}
return(paste(x, "is a happy number."))
}
